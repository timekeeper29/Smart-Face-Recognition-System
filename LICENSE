The library wraps some external face recognition models. Licence types will be
inherited if you are going to use those models. Please check the license types
of those models for production purposes.

- VGG-Face: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/vgg_face/
- FaceNet: https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/blob/master/LICENSE.md
- OpenFace: https://github.com/iwantooxxoox/Keras-OpenFace/blob/master/LICENSE
- DeepFace (model): https://github.com/swghosh/DeepFace
- DeepId: https://github.com/Ruoyiran/DeepID/blob/master/LICENSE.md
- ArcFace: https://github.com/leondgarse/Keras_insightface/blob/master/LICENSE
- Dlib: https://github.com/davisking/dlib/blob/master/dlib/LICENSE.txt
- SFace: https://github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo/blob/master/models/face_recognition_sface/LICENSE

Secondly, different face detector models are being wrapped in DeepFace. License
type of those detectors will be inherited according to your adoption.

- OpenCV Haarcascade: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/4.x/LICENSE
- SSD: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/dnn/face_detector
- Dlib Hog: https://github.com/davisking/dlib/blob/master/dlib/LICENSE.txt
- MtCnn: https://github.com/ipazc/mtcnn/blob/master/LICENSE
- RetinaFace: https://github.com/serengil/retinaface/blob/master/LICENSE
- MediaPipe: https://github.com/google/mediapipe/blob/master/LICENSE
- Yolo: https://github.com/derronqi/yolov8-face/blob/main/LICENSE
- YuNet: https://github.com/ShiqiYu/libfacedetection/blob/master/LICENSE

Besides, age, gender and race / ethnicity models are were trained on VGG-Face.
So, license of VGG-Face will be inherited if you would use one of those models.
